In the classic _Mere Christianity_, C.S. Lewis, the most important writer of the 20th century, explores the common ground upon which all of those of Christian faith stand together. Bringing together Lewis' legendary broadcast talks during World War Two from his three previous books _The Case for Christianity_, _Christian Behavior_, and _Beyond Personality_, _Mere Christianity_ provides an unequaled opportunity for believers and nonbelievers alike to hear this powerful apologetic for the Christian faith.
