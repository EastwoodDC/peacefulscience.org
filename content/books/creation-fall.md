_Creation and Fall_ originated in lectures given by Dietrich Bonhoeffer at the University of Berlin in the winter semester of 1932-33 during the demise of the Weimar Republic and the birth of the Third Reich. In the course of these events, Bonhoeffer called his students to focus their attention on the word of God the word of truth in a time of turmoil.
