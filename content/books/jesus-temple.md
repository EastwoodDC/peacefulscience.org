This volume offers a fresh approach to the question, "Who was Jesus?" Integrating the findings of contemporary Jesus scholarship, Nicholas Perrin explains how Jesus saw himself and his movement as a reconstitution of the temple. By viewing Jesus as temple, Perrin reveals an enriched understanding of Jesus's self-knowledge, ministry, teachings, death, and resurrection and closes the gap between the historical Jesus and the proclamation of the early church.
