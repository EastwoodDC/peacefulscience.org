<span>This book challenges the widespread assumption of the incompatibility of&nbsp;evolution and the biological design argument. Kojonen analyzes the traditional&nbsp;arguments for incompatibility, and argues for salvaging the idea of design in a&nbsp;way that is fully compatible with evolutionary biology. Relating current views to&nbsp;their intellectual history, Kojonen steers a course that avoids common pitfalls&nbsp;such as the problems of the God of the gaps, the problem of natural evil, and the&nbsp;traditional Humean and Darwinian critiques. The resulting deconstruction of the&nbsp;opposition between evolution and design has the potential to transform this&nbsp;important debate.
