<span>Many
 books aim to help beginners explore whether or not evolutionary science
 is compatible with Christian faith. This one probes more deeply to ask:
 What do we learn from modern evolutionary science about key issues that
 are of special theological concern? And what does Christian theology, 
especially in its Reformed expressions, say about those same key 
issues?&nbsp;</span>
<span>Gijsbert van den Brink begins by 
describing the layers of meaning in the phrase “evolutionary theory” and
 exploring the question of how to interpret the Bible with regard to 
science. He then works through five key areas of potential conflict 
between evolutionary theory and Christian faith, spelling out scientific
 findings and analyzing Christian doctrinal concerns along the way. His 
conclusion: although some traditional doctrinal interpretations must be 
adjusted, evolutionary science is no obstacle to classical Christian 
faith.</span>
