__Six Giant Assassins. Goliath Was Only the First.__

Everyone thinks they know the story of David.
No one has heard it told this way before.

In the days of Samuel, Israel’s worst enemy is the Philistines: bloodthirsty worshippers of Dagon the fish god.

Goliath is but one member of an elite warrior cult of six giants, The Sons of Rapha, whose sole ambition is to kill the promised messiah king of Israel.

As David rises, he must flee the demon-possessed King Saul, avoid assassination, withstand the seduction of a Philistine queen, conquer the last of the giants in Israel and overcome his own weakness for many wives.

This gritty romantic action-adventure story will take you places in the Bible you’ve never seen before.

There is so much more to the story than you ever realized.

The War of the Seed continues.

David Ascendant is the seventh book of the series Chronicles of the Nephilim, a biblical epic story of the fallen angelic Watchers and their offspring, the Nephilim giants of Genesis 6.
