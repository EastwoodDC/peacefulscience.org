Close to 60 percent of young people who went to church as teens drop out after high school. Now the bestselling author of _unChristian_ trains his researcher's eye on these young believers. Where Kinnaman's first book _unChristian_ showed the world what outsiders aged 16-29 think of Christianity, _You Lost Me_ shows why younger Christians aged 16-29 are leaving the church and rethinking their faith.

Based on new research, _You Lost Me_ shows pastors, church leaders, and parents how we have failed to equip young people to live "in but not of" the world and how this has serious long-term consequences. More importantly, Kinnaman offers ideas on how to help young people develop and maintain a vibrant faith that they embrace over a lifetime.
