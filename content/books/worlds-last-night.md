In seven witty, lucid, tough-minded essays, Lewis considers questions that challenge the faith of modern Christians. He discusses such topics as the efficacy of prayer, the various uses of the phrase "I believe," the religious implications of life on other planets, the meaning of words like "culture" and "religion," and the idea of the Second Coming.
