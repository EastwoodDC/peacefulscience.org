__Bestselling author Timothy Keller and legal scholar John Inazu bring together a thrilling range of artists, thinkers, and leaders to provide a guide to faithful living in a pluralistic, fractured world.__ How can Christians today interact with those around them in a way that shows respect to those whose beliefs are radically different but that also remains faithful to the gospel? Timothy Keller and John Inazu bring together illuminating stories--their own and from others--to answer this vital question. _Uncommon Ground_ gathers an array of perspectives from people thinking deeply and working daily to live with humility, patience, and tolerance in our time. Contributors include:
- Lecrae
- Tish Harrison Warren
- Kristen Deede Johnson
- Claude Richard Alexander
- Shirley Hoogstra
- Sara Groves
- Rudy Carrasco
- Trillia Newbell
- Tom Lin
- Warren Kinghorn

Providing varied and enlightening approaches to reaching faithfully across deep and often painful differences, _Uncommon Ground_ shows us how to live with confidence, joy, and hope in a complex and fragmented age.

> Loving engagement with folks with whom we disagree does not come easily for many of us with strong Christian convictions. Tim Keller and John Inazu are not only models for how to do this well, but in this fine book they have gathered wise conversation partners to offer much needed counsel on how to cultivate the spiritual virtues of humility, patience, and tolerance that are necessary for loving our neighbors in our increasingly pluralistic culture.

> For anyone struggling to engage well with others in an era of toxic conflict, this book provides a framework, steeped in humility, that is not only insightful but is readily actionable. I'm grateful for the vulnerability and wisdom offered by each of the twelve leaders who contributed to this book. The task of learning to love well - neighbors and enemies alike - is long and urgent, and it can be costly. And yet, as this book shows us, because it is the work of Jesus, we can pursue this love with great hope.
