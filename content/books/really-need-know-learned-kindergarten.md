More than thirty years ago, Robert Fulghum published a simple credo—a credo that became the phenomenal #1 _New York Times_ bestseller _All I Really Need to Know I Learned in Kindergarten_. Today, after being embraced around the world and selling more than seven million copies, Fulghum’s book retains the potency of a common though no less relevant piece of wisdom: that the most basic aspects of life bear its most important opportunities.

Here Fulghum engages us with musings on life, death, love, pain, joy, sorrow, and the best chicken-fried steak in the continental United States. The little seed in the Styrofoam cup offers a reminder about our own mortality and the delicate nature of life...a spider who catches (and loses) a full-grown woman in its web one fine morning teaches us about surviving catastrophe...the love story of Jean-Francois Pilatre and his hot-air balloon reminds us to be brave and unafraid to "fly"...life lessons hidden in the laundry pile...magical qualities found in a box of crayons...hide-and-seek vs. sardines--and how these games relate to the nature of God. _All I Really Need to Know I Learned in Kindergarten_ is brimming with the very stuff of life and the significance found in the smallest details.

In the editions since the first publication of this book, Robert Fulghum has had some time to ponder, to reevaluate, and to reconsider, adding fresh thoughts on classic topics including a short new introduction.
