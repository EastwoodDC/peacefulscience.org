A thoughtful and provocative collection, in the vein of the intellectual spiritual classic _The Weight of Glory_, from N. T. Wright, the influential Bishop, Bible scholar, and bestselling author widely regarded as a modern C.S. Lewis.

An unusual combination of scholar, churchman, and leader, N. T. Wright--hailed by _Newsweek_ as "the world's leading New Testament scholar"--is not only incredibly insightful, but conveys his knowledge in terms that excite and inspire Christian leaders worldwide, allowing them to see the Bible from a fresh viewpoint. In this challenging and stimulating collection of popular essays, sermons, and talks, Wright provide a series of case studies which explore how the Bible can be applied to some of the most pressing contemporary issues facing us, including:
- Why it is possible to love the Bible and affirm evolution
- Why women should be allowed to be ordained
- Where Christians today have lost focus, and why it is important for them to engage in politics--and why that involvement benefits everyone
- Why the Christian belief in heaven means we should be at the forefront of the environmental movement
- And much more
 
Helpful, practical, and wise, _Surprised by Scripture_ invites readers to examine their own hearts and minds and presents new models for understanding how to affirm the Bible in today's world--as well as new ideas and renewed energy for deepening our faith and engaging with the world around us.
