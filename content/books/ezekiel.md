The primary goal of this commentary is to focus attention on what mattered most to Ezekiel and to craft a direction and scope of application that the prophet himself would recognize were he to preach to Godâ€™s people today. In addition to focusing on the most urgent interpretive issues of the text, another goal of this commentary is to explain in simple terms the reasons behind significant translation differences. Embedded in some verses in Ezekiel are particularly complicated or troubling biblical-theological issues. Special topical discussions address these at appropriate locations throughout the commentary.
