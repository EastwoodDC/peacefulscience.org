Science and Religion in *The Genealogical Adam and Eve*

Computational biologist S. Joshua Swamidass’ book, [*The Genealogical Adam and Eve*](/books/genealogical-adam-eve/), has aroused considerable dialogue between science and different religious points of view. His proposes a late Adam and Eve (ca. 10kya) created de novo by God, ancestors of us all, a view which he claims is fully compatible with contemporary evolutionary biology. This work raises questions about the limits of science, the dialogue between religion and science, and interdisciplinary questions about the meaning of “human” that matter to both secular and religious scholars alike.

Author:  S. Joshua Swamidass (Washington University, Saint Louis)

Moderator: William Lane Craig (Talbot School of Theology & Houston Baptist University)
Panelists:

- Michael Heiser (Awakening School of Theology, Jacksonville, Florida)
