In 2010, the BioLogos Foundation's arguments against Adam and Eve were covered in Christianity Today. In response to scientific criticism of these arguments, BioLogos published [this series of articles in 2014 and 2015](https://web.archive.org/web/20200812100251/https://biologos.org/articles/series/genetics-and-the-historical-adam-responses-to-popular-arguments).  

In 2017, [this series was found to have several conclusion-altering scientific errors](/articles/three-stories-on-adam). January 2020, BioLogos [briefly acknolwedged](https://biologos.org/articles/truth-seeking-in-science) errors in this series. However, they declined our request to transparently correct the scientific errors here.

Instead, in June 2021, BioLogos deleted the series. They posted a new article at a different URL with different authorship. The new aricle is a substantially revised version of the first article in this series, back-dated to November 12, 2014. The [conclusions of the new article](/prints/deleted/adam-eve-and-human-population-genetics#implications-for-human-origins) are substatially reivised, but [the note claimed they  were "unchanged."](https://discourse.peacefulscience.org/t/18-million-years-ago-means-500-000/13988)
