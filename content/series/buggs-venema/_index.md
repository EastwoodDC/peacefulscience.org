In 2017, scientist Dennis Venema and theologian Scot McKnight published [Adam and the Genome](/books/adam-genome). This book makes several claims about population genetics that were publicly criticized by Richard Buggs.

In 2017, the BioLogos Foundation published two articles from Dennis Venema to responded to Richard Buggs. 

In 2017 and early 2018, [**this response was found to have conclusion altering scientific errors**](/articles/three-stories-on-adam/). In 2019, the two components of Venema's response was consolidated into [a single article](https://web.archive.org/web/20200106044804/https://biologos.org/articles/a-reply-to-dr-richard-buggs/).

BioLogos declined [our request](/articles/biologos-stealth-deletes-an-article/) to transparently acknowledge and correct their scientific errors. Instead, in June 2021, BioLogos deleted this article.
