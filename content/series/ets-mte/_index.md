The Evangelical Theological Society meeting is one of the most important theological meetings. November 20, 2019, they hosted a symposium on *Mere Theistic Evolution. The articles are published here. 

The book [*Theistic Evolution: A
Scientific, Philosophical, and Theological Critique*](https://www.amazon.com/dp/1433552868) argues that the most common forms of theistic evolution, such as evolutionary creationism, are not consistent with orthodox Christian belief. In response, Mike Murray and John Churchill propose that, nonetheless, some versions of theistic evolution can be consistent with orthodox beliefs. Rather than rejecting evolution as a whole, these better versions of TE are valid options too. Several scholars respond to them.


[A video recording of the full session](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLc0j60GXf64pcz81txpLTY4u4Q9HsbJwp) is available too. Transcripts of the session are available [here](https://www.reasonablefaith.org/videos/interviews-panels/panel-discussion-on-mere-theistic-evolution-eps-2019).
