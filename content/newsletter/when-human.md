When did we become human? Depends on what we mean by "human."

William Lane Craig's recent book gives an excellent tour of some of the relevant scientific evidence. We just published this key chapter of his book.

We've considered this question in other ways too.

Last month, Nathan Lents and Joshua Swamidass spoke together at two Veritas Forums. The first forum, at UNC Chapel Hill, was covered by the [Panda's Thumb](http://pandasthumb.org/archives/2022/03/human-origins-christian-atheist.html). Nathan presented the evidence for human evolution, and Joshua explained how a Christian can respond.

At the next forum, at Christopher Newport University, Nathan and Joshua also wondered together about *when* we became human.

These forums were interleaved with several other trips. A conference at Covenant Seminary on divine action, another visit to Southeastern Baptist Theological Seminary. [A panel with Fuz Rana and Marcus Ross for Rethink315](https://discourse.peacefulscience.org/t/origins-science-and-faith-rethink-315/14885).

 We are going deeper into these grand questions of who we are and where we came from. There is much more to discuss, and some opportunities for you  to participate too.
