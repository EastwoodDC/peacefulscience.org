This month, July of 2022, *Peaceful Science* is programming two virtual events worth joining. See you soon!

## Short Course with Carver Classroom

Hosted by [*The Carver Project*](https://www.carverstl.org/), this is a four week course, one hour each meeting, 
designed for pastors and other ministry leaders in the Church.
 
The class will step through key portions 
of [The Genealogical Adam and Eve](/books/genealogical-adam-eve/). 
Discussion focus on new opportunities and approaches
to engage questions of human origins in 
the context of diverse congregations.

**Science, Adam & Eve, and the Church**

- Dates: Wednesdays, July 6, 13, 20, and 27

## Scholars Workshop with the ASA

There is a new scientific consensus on Adam and Eve, and we want scholars to be informed. 
If you ever publish at the intersection of faith and science, this three hour workshop is
meant for you.
