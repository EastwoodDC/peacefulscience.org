Ending the Evolution Wars requires a response to the theological objections of evolutionary skeptics. 

In 2017, several Intelligent Design scholars  wrote a book, the Crossway book on Theistic Evolution. They offered  two primary *theological* objections to evolution: (1) evolution is in conflict with the doctrine of God's providence, and (2) evolution is in conflict with a historical Adam and Eve.

In 2019, Michael Murray and John Churchill published their response, *Mere Theistic Evolution* (MTE). They argued that divine providence and a historical Adam and Eve are, in fact, compatible with evolutionary science.

Several scholars responded to MTE at *The Evangelical Theological Society* (ETS) meeting that year.

To renew and reopen the conversation on MTE, we are publishing the articles from the ETS session over the next month.
