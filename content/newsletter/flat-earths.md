We are publishing a four part series of excerpts on most entertaining of books on the history of science, *Flat Earths and Fake Footnotes,*

> Why won't this stubborn pseudohistory die? To the rescue comes Peterson,
a historian extraordinaire with many stories to tell. Exuding a palpable glee, he
quests to debunk the grand pseudohistorical myths of conflict. His book about books
leads the reader in an adventure across centuries. Hacking through the webs of false
references and out-right fabrications, the payoff is a glimpse of what really happened.
The truth is far more hopeful than the fiction. Rather than inevitable conflict, the true
arc of science and religion might be dialogue, maybe even friendship. May this book
get the wide readership it deserves.

On the same topic, we published an excerpt from Kenneth Kemp too.

Of course, do not miss  Ken Miller's AAR/SBL paper. He is an entertainer too, so watch the video if you can.
