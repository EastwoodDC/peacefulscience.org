This week, thousands of scholars are flying to Denver for the meetings of The American Academic of Religion (AAR) and the Evangelical Theological Society (ETS).

Two sessions, on Wednesday and Saturday, will be covering Andrew Loke's new book: [*The Origin of Humanity and Evolution: Science and Scripture in Conversation*](https://www.amazon.com/dp/0567706354/). Andrew, William Lane Craig, and S. Joshua Swamidass are speaking in both sessions. 

Meet us in Denver if you can. We will be sharing more about the growing conversation in the coming weeks.
