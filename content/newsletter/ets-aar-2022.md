This week, thousands of scholars are flying to Denver for the meetings of The American Academic of Religion (AAR) and the Evangelical Theological Society (ETS). Of the topics will be Andrew Loke's new book: [*The Origin of Humanity and Evolution: Science and Scripture in Conversation*](https://www.amazon.com/dp/0567706354/).


> What are humans and how did we arise? The story of human evolution seems to contradict with the old story in Scripture of Adam and Eve. Can these sacred and natural histories be held together? Much conflict swirls around this question. But our best science tells us that Adam and Eve, if they were real people, would have been genealogical ancestors of us all. This recent advance in scientific understanding is stimulating a productive conversation between scientists, theologians, exegetes, and philosophers. We are sorting out the image of God and the Fall, considering together the grand question of what it means to be human. At the crossroads of this lively exchange, the philosopher Loke courageously explores a new range of possibilities, delineating the range that makes most theological sense to him. Sure to surprise many, even the concerns of many anti-evolutionists, including a literal reading of Scripture, can be attended while affirming evolution. Whether we agree or disagree with the particulars, Lokeâ€™s contribution is undeniably important; this book is a milestone in the larger conversation.
