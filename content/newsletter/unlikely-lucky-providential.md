In *Mere Theistic Evolution*, Murray and Churchill respond to the theological objections of Christians skeptical of evolution.  One objection to which they respond is the apparent contradiction between "random" evolution and the doctrine of providence.

How do we understand a long series of improbable events?  Unlikely? Luck? Or Providence?

Stephen Meyer is one of the most prominent Intelligent Design scholars. He argues an improbable series of events demonstrate that evolution is unlikely. Therefore, we need not determine if evolution is in conflict with Christian theology.

William Lane Craig is a leading philosopher, and he disagrees. He writes, 

> Properly understood, random mutations are entirely compatible with teleology and a robust doctrine of divine providence.

Randomness. An improbable series of events.

Unlikely? Lucky? or Providential?
