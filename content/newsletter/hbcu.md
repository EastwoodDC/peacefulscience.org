February is Black History month.

As wikipedia explains, [for a century after the end of slavery](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Historically_black_colleges_and_universities) in the United States in 1865, most colleges and universities in the Southern United States prohibited all African Americans from attending, while institutions in other parts of the country regularly employed quotas to limit admissions of Black people. 

[Historically black colleges and universities (HBCUs)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Historically_black_colleges_and_universities) are institutions of higher education in the United States that were established before the Civil Rights Act of 1964 with the intention of primarily serving the African-American community. HBCUs were established to provide opportunities to African Americans and are largely responsible for establishing and expanding the African-American middle class.

This week we interviewed Sierra Nance, a scientist who studied at a historically black college.
