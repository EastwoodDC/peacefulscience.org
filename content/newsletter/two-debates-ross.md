Dr. Marcus Ross is a young earth creationist, and a paleontologist.
He is also one of the contributors to a four-views book on Adam and Eve, along with Andrew Loke, Kenton Sparks,
and William Lane Craig. For those looking to include creationists, we often suggest Ross as a speaker. 

In October 2021, Ross and Dr. Swamidass debated the question, ["What Should Creationists *Think of The
Genealogical Adam and Eve?*"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zCyjDbahdr0) This debate is now online.

Last week, August 2022, Ross debated Michael Jones (from Inspiring Philosophy) on the question, ["Is Evolution Compatible with Genesis?"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K-dPOh4VN14) This debate was live-streamed, and has already been viewed by over 17,000. In this debate, Ross raised an objection to [*The Genealogical Adam and Eve*](/books/genealogical-adam-eve), and Dr. Swamidass responded in an article linked below. 

The conversation on human origins continues, and there is much more to share. We are finding that better way.
