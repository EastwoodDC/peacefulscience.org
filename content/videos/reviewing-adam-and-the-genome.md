title: Reviewing Adam and the Genome
---

On April 12, 2017, I gave an invited lecture with Dr. Ken Cuffey at Urbana Seminary, reviewing the book by Scot McKnight and Dennis Venema, *Adam and the Genome*.

This book is important. There is much with which to agree. However, I depart from them on their main thesis, that both science and theology are ambivalent about Adam and Eve. Critically, key information was let of out of this book about [genealogical science](https://peacefulscience.org/genealogical-science/). This omission confuses the theological and scientific analysis substantially.

A complete review will appear in *Sapientia*, as part of an [online symposium](http://henrycenter.tiu.edu/2017/06/adam-and-the-genome-introducing-the-symposium/) run by the Creation Project.

## In the Divide

One thing is certain, reactions to *Adam and [the] teaching of Scripture. Others will hear a dangerous denial of important doctrine, a dismissive denial of Intelligent Design and scientific creationism.

I am a scientist and a Christian that affirms both evolution and a historical Adam: a real person [in] two sides, seeking peace.

Even [in] unwittingly pressing science if it encourages disobedience to God.

Even [in] origin story of our modern world. We need those with whom we disagree to articulate their positions, just as Venema and McKnight have done here. Even if we disagree, they give truthful account of how most scientists understand our evolutionary origins.

Ahead of us all is [the] most significant issues.

Let us work together now for peace.
