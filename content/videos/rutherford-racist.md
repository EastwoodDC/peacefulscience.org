---

With the death of George Floyd, we are facing societal questions about ancestry. *What is the meaning of race?* Science has important information to add to the conversation. Dr. Adam Rutherford authored a book, released next month, which is important for our moment.

Today, two biologists, Dr. Lents and Dr. Swamidass, interview geneticist Adam Rutherford about his new book, "[*How to Argue With a Racist*](https://amzn.to/2zTZyiR). Come join a conversation with three biologist about the surprising science of race.

We might wonder...*why* even argue with a racist? Don't forget [the black man that talked 200 KKK Members out of their robes](https://discourse.peacefulscience.org/t/black-man-talks-200-kkk-members-out-of-robes/5592).

> If you spend five minutes with your worst enemy --- it doesn't have to be about race, it could be about anything...you will find that you both have something in common. As you build upon those commonalities, you're forming a relationship and as you build about that relationship, you're forming a friendship. That's what would happen. I didn't convert anybody. They saw the light and converted themselves.

> One day while Megan was holding a 'God hates Jews' sign during a protest in New Orleans, a man named David, who ran a blog called 'Jewlicious', approached her after several months of heated but friendly arguments online. Megan said: 'He brought me a Middle Eastern dessert from Jerusalem, where he lives, and I brought him kosher chocolate.' The **interaction with the outside world blurred the lines of good and evil** enforced by the church during Megan's childhood and **she slowly became aware of hypocrisy within Westboro** Baptist Church's preaching.

> Megan said: 'How could we claim to love our neighbor while at the same time praying for God to destroy them?
