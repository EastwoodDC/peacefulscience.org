*Peaceful Science* hopes to encourage conversation about the grand question of what it means to be human. One way we do this is by hosting pre-prints and post-prints of academic articles. 

**Pre-prints** are scholarly articles published without formal peer review. Some preprints may have been first published in non-scholarly contexts, such as blogs. In the future, the authors may choose submit these articles to peer-reviewed journals and conferences. Publishing these articles as preprints brings them into the formal academic record, where they can be cited and publicly engaged.

**Post-prints** are scholarly articles published after first being presented in a conference or a closed access publication. These articles may have been peer reviewed, and are linked to the first context they were published. Publishing these articles as post-prints makes them accessible to scholars in other fields and the larger public. 

All post-prints and pre-prints are assigned DOIs to facilitate citation. In both cases, critical commentary and discussion is welcomed. We encourage post-publication review of prints by qualified scholars.
