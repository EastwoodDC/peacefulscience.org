*Peaceful Science* hopes to encourage conversation about the grand question of what it means to be human. One way we do this is by publishing academically and historically important articles that have been deleted by other organizations. 

Each article in this section is published under Fair Use doctrine, usually *without* the permission of the original authors or publisher. 

These are influential articles with histories. The "online" and "modified" dates corresponds to any editorial comments and additions. The "created" date  corresponds to when the deleted article was first published. In returning these articles to the academic record, there is an opportunity to advance public understanding of science. 

We make a good faith effort to recreate and accurately represent the original version of each deleted article. But some details are hard determine with accuracy. For example, articles are annotated with the date of deletion, but this date is difficult to establish with high precision. 

Each article is enhanced with editorial notes that explain the context and importance of each article, and why it was deleted.  In some cases, we also add references to articles.
All editorial additions are identifiable with a light gray background.  *Peaceful Science* takes responsibility for the accuracy of these editorial changes. Please contact us about any inaccuracies, so that we may correct them.
