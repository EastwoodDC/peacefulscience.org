## Zipporah and the Cushite Wife of Moses

One little verse in the Moses narrative has created a universe of speculation to this very day (okay, it’s not the only one. I see a pattern here too). All the way near the end of their wandering, Israel is in Kadesh and about to send the spies into Canaan. Led and taught by Moses as Yahweh’s mouthpiece, they have experienced all the miracles of deliverance and provision in the desert. Yet Aaron and Miriam let their egos flare up, and they challenge Moses’s identity as sole authority over Israel. They think they should be able to speak for God too. But look at the reason why they challenge him.

> Miriam and Aaron spoke against Moses __because of the Cushite woman whom he had married, for he had married a Cushite woman__. And they said, “Has Yahweh indeed spoken only through Moses? Has he not spoken through us also?” (Numbers 12:1–2)

Scholarship has established with as much certainty as is possible that Cush (also spelled as Kush) was a kingdom south of Egypt in the area we now call Ethiopia, Africa. And Cushites were black-skinned people just as Ethiopians are today.

Moses had married a black woman from Kush/Cush. While it is tempting with our modern bias to reduce this to a case of “racist” anger in Miriam and Aaron, the ancient context doesn’t warrant it. While the complaint is certainly an accusation of Moses doing something wrong by marrying the woman, the color of skin was an irrelevant issue to the Hebrews. Nationality however, was not.

Yahweh had demanded a separation of Israel from the nations (Deuteronomy 32:8-10), but Israel included aliens and sojourners who had converted to Torah, including peoples of all colors and nations (Exodus 12:48). In fact, the Exodus deliverance included people from those nations, called “a mixed multitude” (Exodus 12:38).

Miriam and Aaron weren’t reacting to intermarriage with a person of another color. They were reacting to intermarriage with a person of another nation (Gentile). But this was not simplistic xenophobia like the modern political notion of “nationalism” is misused as.

Though God’s command was not as exhaustive as it appears to be,[^1] the principle of avoiding intermarriage with other nations was based upon religion, not race or politics. This principle is “You shall not enter into marriage with them, neither shall they with you, for surely they will turn away your heart after their gods.” (1 Kings 11:1-2). Foreign nations were evil because they worshipped false gods, not because of race, politics or other modern notions.

[^1]: The only strict command by God was to deny intermarriage with the seven condemned (_herem_) nations of Canaan. The fact is that the history of Israel includes many exceptions, including Ruth the Moabitess and Rahab the Canaanite harlot, both in the lineage of Jesus the Messiah! But the principle can be seen in general throughout the Old Testament. Solomon’s wives as quoted in 1 Kings 11:1-2 were not all from the seven _herem_ nations alone, yet they are condemned for the same principle of “turning away the heart after their gods.”

But here’s a complication. Exodus 12:21 says that Moses married a Midianite woman named Zipporah, a woman from another nation. The questions start to build up like congealed waters of Yam Suph. Why does this Kushite wife not show up anywhere else in Moses’s story? Was she a deceased wife before Zipporah? Or was she a second wife after Zipporah’s unmentioned death? Did Moses have two wives? Or was Zipporah herself the Kushite wife?

To tell my Moses story, I had to enter another quagmire and answer those questions. And the first angle to address was Zipporah’s identity.

The text lays out clearly that Zipporah was a Midianite. As we have already discovered, Midian was way over in Arabia, and Kush was way over beneath Egypt, both separated by a wide peninsula of several hundred miles and two mighty seas. They are completely different peoples with different histories, and the Midianites were most likely not black-skinned.

Or were they? Some argue that Zipporah could have been “Kushite in ancestry and Midianite in culture.”[^2] Ancient historians, such as Strabo, had noted that Ethiopians lived on both shores of the Red Sea. But this assumes the Sinai Peninsula as the location of Midian, which has been discredited earlier. They’re still too far away. Of course, it does not discount the idea that Midians as a nomadic people might have strayed into the “Land of Turquoise” and even intermixed to some degree with Kushites. Maybe one of Jethro’s wives was a Kushite, and Zipporah was her daughter. That might make her Kushite in ancestry, Midianite by marriage and culture.

There is another intriguing possibility I discovered while reading the ancient Jewish historians Josephus and Artapanus. Both of these men write about a story of Moses that is not in the Bible but appears to be based on other ancient historical sources (with some differences). They tell of Moses as a general of Pharaoh’s army fighting the Kushites/Ethiopians to gain back territory taken by their southern opponents. As it turns out, this fits the historical reality of that time period during Sobekhotep IV’s reign as Pharaoh. Josephus adds an element of interest that fits the biblical reference to a Kushite wife. It says that Kush had conquered Egyptian cities up the Nile as far as Memphis. Moses was commissioned to regain Egyptian territory. He did so, pushing the invaders back to the Kushite city of Saba/Kerma, where he set up a difficult siege. The daughter of the king, a Kushite princess named Tharbis, saw Moses and fell in love with him. She offered surrender of the city in exchange for their marriage, a common ancient form of peace negotiation between warring kingdoms. Here’s the text of Josephus as he tells it:

> However, while Moses was uneasy at the army’s lying idle (for the enemies durst not come to a battle), this accident happened:—Tharbis was the daughter of the king of the Ethiopians [Kushites]: she happened to see Moses as he led the army near the walls, and fought with great courage; and admiring the subtility of his undertakings, and believing him to be the author of the Egyptians’ success, when they had before despaired of recovering their liberty ... she fell deeply in love with him; and upon the prevalency of that passion, sent to him the most faithful of all her servants to discourse with him about their marriage. He thereupon accepted the offer, on condition she would procure the delivering up of the city; and gave her the assurance of an oath to take her to his wife; and that when he had once taken possession of the city, he would not break his oath to her. No sooner was the agreement made, but it took effect immediately; and when Moses had cut off the Ethiopians, he gave thanks to God, and consummated his marriage, and led the Egyptians back to their own land.[^3]

Egyptologist David Rohl suggests an Egyptian version of the Greek name Tharbis as Tjarbit, so I used that name in my novel.[^4]

[^4]: Rohl, David. [_From Eden to Exile: The Five-Thousand-Year History of the People of the Bible_](https://www.amazon.com/Eden-Exile-Five-Thousand-Year-History-People/dp/1882514580/) (London: Random House, 2002), 186.

There is archaeological evidence supporting this story in the form of a life-sized monument to Sobekhotep IV in one of the Kushite cities near Kerma, deep in the heart of ancient Kush. Such kingly statues indicate victory and authority over the region. Sobekhotep was the Pharaoh for whom Moses fought.[^5]

But there are some problems with the marriage of Moses to this Kushite princess Tharbis/Tjarbit. He supposedly marries her before he leaves Egypt, sometime before he is forty years old. But when he embarks on his journey to Midian, he is described as being alone in the biblical text (Exodus 2:11-22). There is never any mention of this woman—as if she doesn’t exist. While it is true that the story does not always reveal every detail of reality, this is a detail that would be significant if left out.

If Moses did not bring Tharbis/Tjarbit with him, then he would have left her in Egypt. But that would be a cruel thing for Moses to do that is not consistent with his character. In that ancient culture, the wife and family of a man condemned to death by Pharaoh would surely have been punished with Pharaoh’s wrath. Moses would never leave his beloved to such fate.

{{< amazon `0099416565` >}}

If he did leave her, he would have been doubly cruel because he had no intentions of returning, another inconsistency with his integrity. If he had left her and she was not harmed by Pharaoh, then Moses would have returned to her after 40 years, causing quite a bit of traumatic pain and problems with his other wife. Yet again, her existence isn’t even hinted at in a scenario like this.

So one other possibility is that Tjarbit could have died before Moses left. This would maintain Moses’s moral character without violating the text. But this is not mere speculation. It is also rooted in another non-canonical story of Moses from Artapanus.

Remember that Egyptian campaign against Kush? Artapanus has some elements missing from Josephus: It describes Moses’s exalting victory over Kush, which then breeds envy in Pharaoh Sobekhotep’s heart. He fears Moses’s glory will surpass his own, so he hatches a plot to assassinate the general—his own adopted son—on a false pretext. He orders an assassin Chanethothes to do the dirty deed:

{{< amazon `1246986078` >}}

> But when the Egyptians were alienated from [Pharaoh Sobekhotep IV], he bound his friends by an oath not to report to Moses the plot which was being contrived against him, and he appointed the men who were to kill [Moses].  
When however no one would obey him, Chenephres [Pharaoh Sobekhotep IV] reproached Chanethothes, who promised to make the attempt when he found an opportunity.  
And Merris [Moses’s adopted Egyptian mother] having died about this time, [Pharaoh Sobekhotep] professed to give the body to Moses and Chanethothes to carry it over into regions beyond Egypt and bury it, supposing that Moses would be slain by Chanethothes.  
But while they were on the way, one of those who were cognizant of the plot reported it to Moses; and he being on his guard buried Merris himself  
Then Aaron the brother of Moses, having learned about the plot, advised his brother to flee into Arabia [Midian]; from Memphis.  
But when Chanethothes was informed of the flight of Moses, he lay in ambush intending to kill him; and when he saw him coming, he drew his sword against him, but Moses was too quick for him, and seized his hand, and drew his sword and slew Chanethothes.[^6]

At the advice of Egyptologist David Rohl, I changed the spelling of Chanethothes to the more Egyptian spelling of Khanethothes for the novel.[^7]

The astute reader will notice a problem with this story as it relates to the biblical narrative. It seems to indicate that this attempt to kill Moses instigates his fleeing to Midian rather than Moses’s murder of the Egyptian taskmaster.

In order to maintain the essence of this story without violating the truth of Scripture, I altered it a bit to integrate it into the biblical story, so that it would all fit and provide a stronger confirmation of the biblical story. But I won’t spoil it for you. You’ll have to read the novel to find out.
