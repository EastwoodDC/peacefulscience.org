Is my scientific work on genealogical ancestry peer-reviewed? 

Yes, my work was peer-reviewed, by a very large number of scientists, both pre- and post-publication. This is [an ongoing process](/articles/managing-mistakes/), in which I have engaged all credible scientific criticism of my work, being sure to quickly acknowledge any of my mistakes. It is through engaging with other scientists that critics have been won over, and my work was refined and improved.

To be sure, some of the early reviews were, in fact, extremely. negative. It was almost never published. But there is an important twist. The *reason* for the negativity was entirely theological, not scientific.

My book, *The Genealogical Adam and Eve* was published in 2019, but the core scientific argument was [first published in 2018, in a peer-reviewed article for *Perspectives on Science and the Christian Faith* (PSCF)](https://asa3.org/ASA/PSCF/2018/PSCF3-18Swamidass.pdf). This is the journal of the American Scientific Affiliation, one of the most important professional organizations in the science and faith conversation.

This is a journal run by Christians, but it is aligned with mainstream science. Many, perhaps even most, of the scholars in the ASA do not believe Adam and Eve are more than a myth. For these reasons and more, the journal sent my manuscript out for review by six reviewers. Half were theologians. Half were scientists. The reviews were extensive. All reviewers objected on theological grounds, arguing against a historical Adam and Eve. None of the reviewers disputed the science.


## Do Not Publish This Article

So my article faced peer review from several scientists with every reason to find errors in my work. They did not find scientific errors. They only had theological objections.

To be sure, the reviews of this article were among the most negative I've recieved in my career. I've published over 80 peer review articles, so that's saying something. At the same time, there were not any scientific objections. Paradoxically, perhaps, the theological bias of the reviewers gave me great confidence that the scientific argument I was making was very strong.

Reviewer \#5 was the most opposed of all, reccomending against publication entirely.  His argument was primarily based on theology, even as he restated and agreed with my key scientific conclusions.

So what exactly did this reviewer write?[^1]

[^1]:  The editor of PSCF and the president of ASA confirm that they have no policy against publishing peer reviews. So, with that in mind, it is quoted here in full.

> The science behind genealogical ancestry is not controversial. All humans do share recent common ancestors (within the last several thousand years). The probability that all humans share two ancestors in common from ~6,000 years ago is very high. There are likely scores of such ancestors, most of whom have not passed down any DNA to the present day. They are genealogical ancestors, not genetic ancestors. This observation, however, does not lead to the conclusion that two of these ancestors were Adam and Eve, a literal couple referred to in Genesis. It does not exclude it, nor does it support it.
> 
> By way of analogy, consider how Neanderthals are now known to be ancestors of present-day, non-sub Saharan Africa humans, though not their unique ancestors. This is not genetically controversial. It would not then follow, however, to conclude that the Nephilim of Genesis were Neanderthals. One simply does not follow from the other---other evidence would have to be supplied. The science does not support it, it merely “makes it possible”. How “probable” it is would have to be judged on theological grounds, not scientific ones. The same conundrum faces this paper---the science merely “makes it possible”---it does not support the conclusions drawn, nor does it disallow them. If we accept the proposal at face value, however, it has troubling theological implications. It means that Adam and Eve, as the bearers of the Image of God, breed with non-humans who happen to be the same biological species as they are. The children of such unions are human, it appears, who then must also breed with the non-human, but biologically compatible, animals around them. Indeed, this must take place for the model to work, and eventually the entire planet is “humanized” through descent. If Adam and Eve are at ~6,000 years ago in the middle east, then there are no humans---creatures who bear the imago dei---for ~ 194,000 years of human history as we see it in the fossil record. Even the “great leap forward” seen in the paleontological record (cave art, complex tools, evidence of religious practice, etc) would be the product of non-human animals who nonetheless happen to have anatomically modern human skeletons. It also means that several areas of the planet have to wait longer to “become human”. Under this model, most---almost all---of the ancestors of sub-saharan Africans, indigenous Americans, Australian aborigines, and similar would be animals. Only when they are finally reached by outsiders “bearing the image”---Europeans, humans of middle eastern descent, etc---would their children “become human” upon interbreeding. Such interbreeding would be a form of bestiality, presumably, since this is the joining of “true humans” with non-human animals. It should go without saying that I find this model theologically distasteful. Imagine, in the present day, if a people group was found that had been genealogically isolated since before 6,000 years ago. Under this theology, they would be animals---not bearing the image of God, and thus not deserving of rights. If, however, there was interbreeding between this group and “true humans”, then the children of these pairings would be truly human, but only one of their parents would be. If this strikes us as horrific in the present day, it should be just as distasteful to imagine in the past. There is also no hint of such goings on in Genesis, where the prohibition against bestiality surely is relevant. If this is really starting with Adam and Eve, then why is there no hint of this process recorded in the Genesis narratives?

> So, should such a model be found in the pages of PSCF? I don’t think it should. It is ad hoc. It takes a known feature of human populations (that there are recent common ancestors of everyone who are not uniquely our common ancestors) and effectively says “See? That could be Adam and Eve. Science can’t disprove it.” Science also cannot disprove that Neanderthals are the Nephilim, but I similarly don’t think that speculation is worthy of the journal either.


There is much to say about this review, but focus on three points: 

1. This reviewer is a scientist, yet he emphasizes a *theological* argument. which depends on a highly prejudiced and inaccurate summary of the manuscript, reasoning that echoed [an article published earlier that year.](https://henrycenter.tiu.edu/2017/07/response-to-the-symposium-part-1/) The [response to this earlier article](https://potiphar.jongarvey.co.uk/2017/10/06/the-racist-adam/) by Jon Garvey makes clear this reasoning is not valid.

2. The reviewer could not find any scientific errors, even though the reviewer was very intent on preventing publication of the article. 

3. The reviewer is not merely disagreeing with a different opinion. Rather, this is a scientist arguing against the publication of valid science, for *theological* reasons.


Ironically, the  negative bias in this reviewer's theological argument increases confidence that there were no scientific errors. The reviewer had every reason to find scientific problems, but couldn't.

## One Race, One Blood

Still, with such negative reviews, what happened with this article? Was it published?

This is to the ASA's credit. James Peterson, the editor of PSCF, made a good decision. After seeing my 25 page response to the reviewers, he decided to publish my article. 

This positive end was certainly *not* the most likely outcome.  This same prejudiced argument poisoned the well in other places. Evolutionary creationists expounded these specific theological objections as they distanced themselves from my work.

I was not the first person to face this sort of opposition either. Using the same reasoning, for example, Kenneth Kemp's work on ancestry was also excluded from discussion and consideration by evolutionary creationists. 

Such is life.

Ultimately, this opposition was one of the reasons I decided to write a book. In my book, I explain in detail why my work is not intrinsically racist. To the contrary, I show how,

> We are all linked together in the recent past by genealogical ancestry. The human race is a single family, in a common story. Whatever our skin color, country of origin, ethnicity, or culture, we are all one family. We are one blood, one race, the human race.

Most readers now understand *The Genealogical Adam and Eve* is not a slippery slope to racist dehumanization.

Those making these theological arguments have yet to respond, apologize, or walk back these sorts of arguments. Evolutionary creationists agree that my work is scientifically valid, but they still keep their distance.
