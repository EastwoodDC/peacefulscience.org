Josh Swamidass has asked me to write my reaction to the presentations by noted scholars at two symposia on his book [_The Genealogical Adam and Eve_](/books/genealogical-adam-eve/), one hosted by the AAR and the other by the ETS. My only qualification for daring to critique the work of these luminaries is that I was a proponent of the Genealogical Adam and Eve theory a decade before most of them were aware of it, and my own book on it, [_The Generations of Heaven and Earth_](/books/generations-heaven-earth/), was published a month or so after Josh’s.

Overall, in both conferences (I shall deal with them together for convenience) the agreements and disagreements of the contributors follow the lines Josh and I might, and did, expect, since most of them had been aired when the hypothesis was being discussed before any books were published. It is good, though, to have them expressed systematically by leading scholars in their fields.

As a broad generalisation, those least sympathetic to GAE appear to be those closest to the longstanding academic “theology-science project” project exemplified by Ian Barbour _et al_. and _The Center for Theology and Natural Science_, and subsequently by Francis Collins’s _BioLogos_. This intellectual stream has tended to accept evolution axiomatically, and to be far less sympathetic to traditional Christianity. Perhaps, then, their antipathy stems partly from GAE’s different view on the implications of science, and partly from its openness to historical Christianity rather than to more radical theologies like Barbour’s panentheism or open theism.

By contrast, those speakers specialising in the text of the Scriptures appear much more sympathetic to GAE, whatever their reservations about details. This may, of course, be because they lack sufficient scientific knowledge, but it should be noted that the other speakers did not raise much criticism of GAE’s science, but rather asserted science’s incompatibility with the biblical texts.

The above generalisation, however, does not really apply to the two contributors with a philosophy background, Andrew Ter Ern Loke and William Lane Craig. Of these, Loke was trained in medicine before going on to study philosophy and theology, and is very supportive of GAE (with a forthcoming book covering it), whereas Craig came to philosophy via Christian apologetics, and is noted mainly for his historical and cosmological defences of the faith. Craig is unconvinced by GAE. 

In the comments that follow, I will bypass the presentation by **Paul Metzer**, as his worthwhile contribution discusses  Swamidass’s irenic approach to discussion, rather than the hypothesis itself. I will not attempt an exhaustive critique of each contribution, but draw attention to particular points of agreement or disagreement in order, I hope, to suggest what, in my subjective view, was insufficiently emphasised in the discussions.

**Greg Cootsona** accuses GAE of being too wedded to narrow biblical literalism:

> Put another way, the hermeneutical position the GAE Hypothesis seeks to defend, and its related theology, does not subsume “consensual Christianity” (Thomas Oden), “mere Christianity” (Richard Baxter, and C.S. Lewis), or what has been believed “everywhere, always, and by all" (Vincent of Lerins).

It is doubtful, in today’s climate, if any universally acceptable statement of common ground amongst those using the label “Christian” can be more than a fudge. Specifically I don’t think the pitting of these names against “biblical inerrantism” does them justice. Baxter, for example, was an inerrantist, and even so found his attempted middle-way between Calvinism and Arminianism in _Catholick Theologie_ was rejected by both sides, as there remained crucial disagreements on principle. Even his proposed doctrinal _minima_ at the Westminster Assembly, the Apostles’ Creed and the Ten Commandments, would be rejected by many progressives now as too doctrinaire. As for Lewis, his disdain for liberal theology was matched only by the liberals’ rejection of _Mere Christianity_ as undoing “centuries of theological progress.”[^1] Cootsona seems to express, in practice, the same attitude as the latter when he says:

> At the AAR, much of Christian biblical scholarship and theology in its engagement with science has moved on from an inerrantist hermeneutic as its sole, or even primary, focus.

“Disagreement” is the language of equals: “moving on” that of assumed superiority. His opponents could as validly speak of “falling away.” Yet Cootsona commends Lewis on  his “typological” understanding of the Eden story, saying:

> Concepts, especially “types” in the Bible can have power without referring to historical events ...”

But to Lewis, whilst not an “inerrantist” in the narrow sense, the type must have a historical referent: for all that he acknowledged a “mythic” element to the Genesis narrative Lewis believed in Paradisical man, and an historical fall. In his words “_Someone or something whispered that they could become as gods._”
 
**Ken Miller** stresses  his long involvement in the science-faith origins debate, but seems to have engaged least of all the participants with the arguments of [_The Genealogical Adam and Eve_](/books/genealogical-adam-eve/), and indeed with other recent work on Genesis in the context of science. He writes:

> Any attempt to confirm universal ancestry from a Biblical first couple also presents a profound scientific problem. In its effort to say that the Adam and Eve story is correct, it ignores the obviously false Genesis narrative of natural history in which the Adam and Eve story is deeply embedded.
 
To insist on Genesis as an outmoded scientific narrative of natural history is a tired fallacy lacking   consideration for genre and theological intention. In particular, it absurdly requires ancient texts to follow  modern norms of both historiography and science documentary. Miller incidentally denies divine authorship by calling the account “obviously false,” a serious step beyond suggesting a metaphorical or allegorical meaning. Yet even Lewis, who was a professional student of mythology, was careful to distinguish literary genre from the question of divine truth:

> ... allegory, parable, romance, and lyric might be inspired as well as chronicle.[^2]

[^2]: Lewis, C.S. ["Letter to Corbin Carnell"](https://www.crivoice.org/lewisbib.html) sent April 4, 1953

By contrast **Andrew Loke**, whilst not dwelling too much on the nature of the Genesis text, clearly distinguishes what Swamidass is trying to do from what many critics _assume_ he is doing:

> ... Swamidass is suggesting a possible model which shows how the Scripture is consistent with scientific evidence (Task C); Swamidass is _not_ claiming that his model is an interpretation of what the Scripture affirms (Task A). Sadly, many critics of Swamidass’ Genealogical Adam Model (GAE) have missed this simple logical distinction; they have misunderstood Swamidass’ project by criticising it on the assumptions of Task A.

In other words, because the book is not intending to show that the Bible endorses GAE, but simply that it is compatible with it, questions of genre remain open. To oppose it because the text might *not* be “literally” true is simply to assert dogmatically that one’s own non-literal interpretation is “obviously” true – it is not an argument.

I was interested to hear **Michael Heiser**’s take, because of his original and astute approach to supernaturalism in the Bible. Like Loke, he recognises that Swamidass is not seeking an accommodationist interpretation of the Bible:

> He is instead offering a hypothesis that presumes (really, insists) that general revelation, the information gleaned from the study of our biology via the tools of science, be allowed to tell one story, while Scripture be allowed to tell its story. The two stories follow similar trajectories and ultimately entwine, but they are nonetheless different.

Heiser concludes that nothing in the Bible contradicts GAE (whilst nothing clearly endorses it), but note that he in no way denies that, in the real world, the accounts might genuinely “entwine,” and he seems to find the model plausible.

Heiser is particularly interested in the much-aired “racist” connotations of GAE, and is scientifically  informed enough to agree with Josh (and I) that

> ... the very concept of “race” being biologically determined and detectable is a flawed modern concept. Swamidass is an expert on genetics, so he knows the idea is nonsense.

This leads him to explore what is emerging as the central theological question about GAE: the status of those “outside the garden.” His conclusion is that this is not at all a problem for the biblical text, even if it might be for our emotional response:

> We know from elsewhere in Romans 5 that Paul is talking about Adam, and so he has the Fall of Genesis 3 in view, the first sin of humankind. There’s no ambiguity on that point. Romans 5:12’s statement that, “just as sin came into the world through one man,” is about the first sin, which can only refer to what happened in Eden to the man Adam (and Eve, by extension). It thus applies only to Adam, Eve, and their progeny—no one else. The ensuing phrase (“and death through sin”) has nothing to do with physical death of any animal or person _before_ the Fall. It is a comment about the event of Eden and circumstances _after_ the Fall. Death now invades the Edenic storyline which will affect all of Adam and Eve’s descendants. The original desire of God did not include death.

Therefore:

> The practical result of this approach is that the everlasting destiny of creatures that have intelligence or some other capacity in a way that transcends the animal world are outside of both the act that makes redemption necessary and that secures redemption. They may be part of the new earth regardless. Animals certainly are (the new Eden is what the old Eden was supposed to be, only on a global scale). 

This possibility is, of course, speculative. But Heiser deliberately argues only from the Bible, his professional field, which was written not to tell us about everything, but about _us_, who are all Adam’s children.

**Richard Averbeck**, like Heiser, keeps the biblical text at the centre, and like him concludes that GAE is plausible, though not demanded by the text. Indeed, it has led him to examine the text more closely:

> [H]is discussion has influenced me to take more careful note of the fact that Genesis 1 presents humans as “pastoralists,” so to speak, occupied with animals. The account of the creation of Adam and Eve in Genesis 2, on the other hand, pictures them as agriculturalists, cultivating the ground and caring for the orchard in the Garden of Eden (Gen 2:15—17; cf. also v. 5b) ...

> I wonder if this might suggest that we should see the creation of humanity in Genesis 1 more broadly, and Genesis 2 as a sequential account of the later special creation of the model man and woman, Adam and Eve, something similar to what Joshua Swamidass suggests (pp. 173—83). On the other hand, could it be that all we should see here is the distinction between Genesis 1 as forming and filling the cosmos as a whole, and Genesis 2 as a further explanation of the development of human life on the earth?

But a large population outside the garden remains a problem for him:

> I am not convinced of his whole argument, especially since his particular theory requires a relatively large population of humans on the earth before the creation of Adam and Eve. ... It must be noted, however, that his argument does not require that the Bible recognize the existence of these earlier hominins outside the garden. They are not the subject of what the Bible is really talking about anyway.

I would argue that it is the evidential near-certainty of a relatively large population of people throughout prehistory, and not Josh’s “particular theory,” that calls the shots here. If we have to find a time in the world’s past when there were might have been few or none “outside the garden,” it would be so long ago that we would have to abandon all the details of the account in Gen 1-11. But  Averbeck agrees that the Bible may simply omit such “outsiders” because they are not its subject. If that is admitted, Eden can be placed anywhere in pre-history, or even within history, at the fountainhead of covenant knowledge of Yahweh, without embarrassment to the text or to science.

He goes on to point out that GAE agrees with the authorial conventions of the Bible, in its concentration on genealogy:

> If there are no people born, there is not history. They were very much focused on family and clan life, as is clear from the patriarchal narratives and forward through the history of Israel, and even into the NT.

The question, then, is whether the Eden account is intended as history because of Adam’s genealogy, or is, through genealogy, _pretending_ to be history. Averbeck places such considerations  in the context of Genesis as an “observational” text. And so in Genesis 1

> God’s revelation about his creation work (and also his redemptive work for that matter) is “observational.” In my view, we need to apply this “observational” perspective more fully and pervasively to our reading of the creation texts ... God created the world, but in his revelation about it he us talking about it on the level of what the common readers or hearers of the story, both ancient and modern, could readily observe.

This description accords with the chapter in my [_Generations_](/books/generations-heaven-earth/) on the creation story as “phenomenological”: the inspired theological insights come from observing how the world is now, yet seen in relation to Yahweh as his temple. Genesis 1 is not history, but prophetic insight about the existing world.

Averbeck moves on to apply his “observational” principle to Adam and Eve. I find his argument here slightly ambiguous. He points out that Adam being created from and returning to dust is observational because it is true of us all, as is his familiar need for a wife, and so on. But is he suggesting that Adam is not intended as a historical figure, but only a type? If the latter, I think this takes “observational text” a little too far. 

With reference to Adam, or indeed to _any_ past events, clearly readers themselves cannot observe them. But history (all those people being born) is the means by which observations by departed people may be shared with the living. Abraham marries Sarai not because readers know marriage is a fact, but because that is what Genesis’s sources say happened. Genealogy is the thread that ties Adam and Eve into history.

Averbeck’s treatment of “divine image” is excellent. Citing a key ancient text on how the statue of a king was his “image and likeness” in his domain, he argues forcefully for such a functional view of man as God’s  “image and likeness” in Genesis:

> We are a living “statue” of God in the world, individually and corporately. This is what the imago dei is all about ...

> I have witnessed times in discussions with highly intelligent theologians, philosophers, and biblical scholars combined, wherein the conclusion reached is that no one really knows what the expression means at all. This is precisely because the anchor has come loose in the discussion and the boat is floating out to sea. I have seen the same in print. No. We know <u>**exactly**</u> what it means _in nuce_ ...

Tentatively applying this conclusion about _imago dei_ to those outside the garden, he says:

> I am not sure how all this applies to monogenesis, but it is not just biological. We were all created with the same purpose. If there were people outside the garden before the creation of Adam and Eve in Genesis 2, I suppose they would have had the same purpose too, at least in the long run. God would have had his hand on this too, perhaps in a different kind of way.

This accords with my own understanding, but in my book I add the nuance (following Irenaeus and Psalm 8/Hebrews 2) that through Adam came a new role for mankind within that image-creation, beyond that of Genesis 1, as co-regent of _all_ things under God. Averbeck continues: 

> [T]he Genesis 3 corruption account, the engagement of the cosmic battle between God and the forces of evil, and how it affects us, also finds analogical material in the ANE context. Genesis 3:15b would have been a “proto-evangelion” even to the ancient Israelites. They knew this was not just a snake story. 

Here I agree entirely, as he touches on the biblical theology which, to me, makes a historical Adam necessary. What is accomplished historically in the physical victory of Christ over Satan, sin and death must in the terms of Gen 3 _begin_ historically. Hence I can’t fully agree that:

> We are the ones who have made it complicated. It is focused on what is observable to the naked eye and in the personal and relational experience of all people in all times. The ANE cultural contextual embedding of the text was a resource God used to communicate this and its implications to the ANE Israelites in a way that was powerful for them in the way that both compared and contrasted with ideas in their own world. 

Yet he does conclude:

> The text in Genesis 2 puts the original man and woman in a locatable place in the world of the ANE, somewhere in the Mesopotamian valley. From there it continues with the genealogical descent of all humanity from Adam and Eve. Our story today is a continuation of theirs.

Perhaps we agree on the history after all.

**Ken Keathley** endorsed my book so I have nothing to say against him! He makes a valuable contribution to the frequent claim that “people outside the garden” pose a problem for GAE, in his historical discussion of “antipodes” (and since Copernicus, extra-terrestrials). He suggests that the cultural localness of Christianity is a feature, not a bug:

> Gabriel Fackre calls this the “scandal of particularity.” Christians believe that God was in Christ, reconciling the world to himself. Therefore we proclaim that a particular man accomplished a universal, salvific work. This work was necessary because we also believe that the entire human race was separated from God by the disobedience of one specific man. The Good News is that the last Adam rescues us from the failure of the first Adam (Rom 5:12-21). This claim about these two specific, particular men is indeed scandalous.

This is to concur that Christianity is about salvation history, and that history is about particulars, not universals:

> As James K. S. Smith points out, the doctrine of Original Sin is not just about the what of the human condition, but also the how and the why. The doctrine of Original Sin doesn’t simply teach that we are all sinners; it also explains how we became this way and why such a thing could happen in a world created by a good God.

Even Keathley does not fully address the fact that, from many viewpoints, any account of Adam _must_ exclude people outside the garden. There are progressive Evangelicals who regard the redemption of even the animals from their suffering in a cruelly-created evolutionary world as the proper business of Christianity, so that Genesis is too anthropocentric. But on any old earth view, including progressive creation, there existed hominins showing some of the features that make humans unique. Where can one draw firm lines around humanity (a question Josh discusses in the book)? Wherever they may be drawn, everyone else is outside the garden. 

This leads us neatly on to the presentation by **William Lane Craig**. Of all the contributions, I was most disappointed by his, because I expected more. His problem with GAE centres firmly on his insistence that “humanity” must be defined by certain traits, and that any Adam must be the ancestor of all who ever possessed them. This leads him to argue, though in no great detail, for a far more ancient Adam:

> For it is universally recognized that human beings have existed on this planet for vastly longer than a mere ten thousand years. There is a noteworthy consensus among scientists as to what traits are jointly sufficient for humanity. We are, after all, familiar with ourselves as human beings and therefore know what a paradigmatic human being looks like.

This ignores not only the discussions of _imago dei_ covered above, but the lack of a scientific consensus on “humanness” that Josh covers in his book. Even if there were such a consensus, scientists are not qualified to decide what is sufficient for humanity, or else there would be no argument over abortion or eugenics, nor such shifting opinions as there are about the evolutionary boundaries of “humankind.”

Craig says we recognise what “human” means from personal experience, but we only know what a “descendant of Adam” is like. We have no experience of meeting Neanderthals or Denisovans, still less _Homo habilis_. There are vexed legal arguments about whether even modern apes are “conscious people.” As a philosopher, Craig must also be well aware of the concept of “philosophical zombies” with every human accomplishment except consciousness, in relation to which the question of people outside the garden having culture but not “eternal souls” in the Cartesian mould is surely at least up for discussion.

> Sometimes Josh is tempted to distinguish between what he calls biological, philosophical, and theological humans in an attempt to justify taking the people outside the Garden to be biologically and philosophically human—whatever that amounts to—, but not theologically human. I think that such distinctions are plausibly merely aspectival, not ontological. There is no need or room for an ontological distinction between biological, philosophical, and theological humans, for they are co-extensive. There are just humans, viewed under different aspects.

Yet this is untrue even now, in orthodox theology. The Christian is, we learn from Paul, a new creation: there is an ontological difference between a born-again new creation and a reprobate, yet they are both humans. Scripture views their distinction as fundamental, not aspectival. Why should not such a distinction – perhaps virtually the same distinction – mark off Adam from those outside the garden, whilst both populations remain fully human?

And so I find that, by failing to look deeper into the meaning of “human,” and especially by failing to discuss more biblical concepts such as “image and likeness,” Craig forces himself to bury his Adam in a lost past in which he cannot, actually, be found as the first fully-orbed human. A sentence like this:

> The cave art alone that I have mentioned already rules out the hypothesis that humanity originated on this planet a mere 10,000 years ago, as Josh suggests ...

shows that Craig has really not engaged with Josh’s discussion of humanity, nor with the discussion in my book (of which I sent him a pre-publication copy) about the distinct calling of Adam not to be a symbolic thinker, but to be in personal communion with God as co-regent of all things. Yahweh is not found in palaeolithic art.

Consequently Craig is at the mercy of the ever-changing knowledge of the sophistication of early man.

> The difficult question is whether we can discern when such behaviors _first_ appear in the prehistorical record. Fortunately, it is easy to establish a point _by which_ such traits are clearly present.

This argument is misleading. Yes, we can see such behaviours in their entirety after they arrive, but evolutionary theory would have them arrive gradually and imperceptibly, for it is populations, not individuals, that evolve new species. At some stage, they must be only partially present – barring special creation or saltation. What of one’s innate ability to discern humanness in that case? 

If he posits special creation, he must find, within science, a potential genetic bottleneck of two. Although other work by Swamidass and Richard Buggs has found this to be genetically possible, such an Adam would be placed hundreds of thousands of years ago, long before any evidence of the symbolic thought on which Craig relies for his understanding of humanness. So he does not address in any way at all how his ancient Adam would work in an evolutionary or a creational sense, nor how he could avoid there still being a category “outside the garden” to explain.

Meanwhile, the rest of the Genesis account becomes irrelevant in his scheme.

> Biblically, Josh’s hypothesis has the advantage of preserving the descriptions the events of the primaeval history of Genesis 1-11 as very recent. But this advantage is purchased only at the expense of sacrificing Adam’s being the truly universal progenitor of mankind, which I take to be a vastly more important point theologically than the time at which Adam lived. Moreover, Josh’s hypothesis is based upon a literalistic interpretation of Gen 1-11 which does not take seriously the literary genre of the primaeval history as quasi-mythical in nature and therefore not straightforward history.

Yet in Bill Craig’s estimation the genre is still quasi-mythical _history_, and as noted above history is the recording of events by human witnesses and passed down. Craig gives no explanation of how such  history would be preserved from the distant past: it must become a matter of divine dictation, and the events of Genesis 3-11 that tie Adam to the story of Abraham, the story of Israel, and the story of the David Messiah are left hanging in thin air as unimportant. 

Here Ken Keathley’s thoughts on _particularity_ are relevant. Craig writes:

> (1) The purpose of the primaeval narratives of Gen 1-11 is to portray God’s universal plan for and dealings with humankind.

Is it, though? Or at least, is it only so? Gen 2-11 focus on _particular_ lines of descent leading from Adam to Abraham – and Genesis was written firstly for Israel. Its universalising aspects, especially the Table of Nations, deal with the genealogical and geographical radiation of Adam’s seed from the root – they are _hints_ of God’s universal purpose, not the primary theme. Abraham is to become a blessing to all nations arising from, and after, the Eden narrative because they are all descended from Adam in the fullness of time.

> (2) A comparison of the story of the creation of man in Gen 2 with other ANE creation stories shows that such stories share an etiological interest in telling of how mankind in general came to exist.

> (3) The account in Gen 2 when read at face value is about human origins.

As I point out in my book, Atrahasis is actually about the creation of the people of a _specific_ city state to serve their _specific_ gods: there are also Sumerian stories about people before the creation of these men. So the proper biblical aetiological parallel is the creation of people to worship and serve Yahweh, the true God. And since the Sumerian stories have literary parallels with Genesis, they seem to concern a common historical origin, if they contain history at all.

The key to understanding the Bible overall is that it is primarily salvation _history_, that is the particular things God has done and said to prophets within a tribal and national religious setting, culminating in the universal offer of salvation and eternal life, through the work of Christ, to all nations. That history has its origin in the story of Adam and Eve in Genesis 2-3: there the initial conditions are described, the plan of God laid out, and the apparent defeat of that plan by the forces of evil revealed. The rest of salvation history all flows from that, but becomes meaningless if the foundational narrative does not also belong to history, in the broad sense.

Genealogical Adam and Eve provides a plausible bridge between the created order formally explored by the historical sciences, and the biblical narrative that is accessible, to a greater or lesser extent, to historical study. Without that bridge, the biblical story is self-referential; it is only as true as the characters in the stories, or we as readers, believe it to be. Our spiritual needs are only what we feel they are, and may be explained equally well, and dealt with, by psychology or evolutionary theory as by the biblical narrative.

But a historical Adam and Eve provide an objective explanation of the human condition. And Genealogical Adam and Eve enables that explanation to be grounded in an objectively explored historical past.
