title: An Invitation to Dr. Fazale Rana
---


This letter was [just posted](https://www.facebook.com/fuzrana/posts/10216287239284425) to Dr. Rana's facebook page, and lightly edited here. On Facebook, a Reasons to Believe supporter [asked Dr. Rana](https://www.facebook.com/fuzrana/posts/10216243490870742) to engage my work on population genetics, and Dr. Rana refused.

Since this letter was published, Dr. Rana and I connected, and are planning on engaging more this Fall. Also, [I retracted a key error](https://peacefulscience.org/assess-rtb-model/) in this letter.

Dr. Fazale Rana (of *Reasons to Believe*),
{.dropcap}

I would like to warmly invite you to dialogue on [the article you just reposted](http://www.reasons.org/explore/blogs/the-cells-design/read/the-cells-design/2017/04/26/conservation-biology-studies-elicit-doubts-about-the-first-human-population-size) on population genetics. Many of your points are correct. The case Dennis Venema made against a single couple genetic origin [was flawed](https://evolutionnews.org/2018/05/discussion-is-over-on-adam-and-the-genome-former-biologos-fellow-backs-down/). However, since then, [new work has emerged](https://discourse.peacefulscience.org/t/heliocentric-certainty-against-a-bottleneck-of-two/61) that simultaneously (1) walks back Venema's overstatements of the evidence, and (2) shows that your model is not consistent with the DNA evidence. Over the last several months, many people have asked me how you are receiving the falsification of your model. I'm honestly curious myself.

Your recently reposted article from early 2017, for obvious reasons, does not address findings that came out at the end of 2017. Though you reposted that article in response to [my work on TMR4A](https://discourse.peacefulscience.org/t/heliocentric-certainty-against-a-bottleneck-of-two/61), your article's critique applies to Venema's work, but not mine. Moreover, there is an unlikely consensus forming around this evidence, including both Dr. [Richard Buggs](https://natureecoevocommunity.nature.com/users/24561-richard-buggs/posts/32171-adam-and-eve-lessons-learned) and Dr. [Ann Gauger](https://evolutionnews.org/2018/03/is-there-a-first-human-couple-in-our-past-new-evidence-and-arguments/). At some point, it is my sincere hope that you eventually engage with us.

You regularly speak around the country about your take on the science of Adam, so let's engage the best science to test your position. Otherwise, you might misdirect the Church. As a matter of integrity, invite you to dialogue with me on the science and genetics of Adam. This can be public or private, in person or in a forum. Let's get to the bottom of this together.

As you know, I've given you this invitation in private, and you have given me no response. Questions continue to rise, and I think its time we talked.

Peace,

Dr. S. Joshua Swamidass, MD PhD
