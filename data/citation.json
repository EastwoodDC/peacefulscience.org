    "abstractNote": "In this book, The Genealogical Adam and Eve: The Surprising Science Of Universal Ancestry, S. Joshua Swamidass proposes that God could have created Adam and Eve de novo (i.e God literally took a scoop of dust and transformed it into Adam, put Adam to sleep and took a chunk of his side to make Eve) and that everyone is a descendent of that originally de novo created couple. This part of the hypothesis that Swamidass proposes is in line with the traditional understanding of Adam and Eve's creation and our relationship to them. However, Dr. Swamidass also proposes that there were homo sapiens who lived outside the garden of Eden that Adam and Eve's descendants interbred with once they were kicked out for disobeying God. These homo sapiens who lived outside the garden of Eden numbered in the thousands and came into being through the widely accepted and scientifically established evolutionary process. These humans evolved from lower hominids and share ancestry with the great apes such as chimpanzees, gorillas, and orangutans. This would explain why our genome is so similar to the genome of chimpanzees, gorillas, and so on. We look like we share genetic ancestry with them because we do.\n\n\nWhen they (the evolved humans outside of the Garden Of Eden) interbred with the descendants of Adam and Eve, their genetic material was shared and mixed. This hypothesis enables us to affirm the traditional de novo view of the historical Adam and Eve, that everyone alive today can trace their ancestries back to them but it's also fully compatible with the mainstream scientific consensus of macro-evolution (or universal common ancestry) and the evidence from population genetics that says the number of people in the human population could never have been as low as just two. That's his hypothesis in a nutshell. In his book, he defends its scientific validity using peer-reviewed scientific facts and even builds on the unfinished work of prior scientists.\n\n\nSwamidass correctly points out that the biblical authors had no concept of genetics. DNA hadn't been discovered yet, and it is only appropriate to interpret scripture the way the original author and audience would have understood it. Rather, Dr. Swamidass says, the biblical authors thought in terms of genealogies. Swamidass explains that asserting that Adam and Eve are our universe GENEALOGICAL ancestors isn't the same as asserting that they're universal GENETIC ancestors of all people. Swamidass argues that population genetics has only disproved the latter, but not the former, and this is important because the former is what the biblical authors were claiming.\n\n\nFor those who, like me, are committed to a historical Adam and Eve, and who, unlike me, think The Bible requires Adam and Eve to be de novo creations, and who also find the evidence for macro-evolution compelling, and just don't know how to integrate what they know from God's Word and God's World, this book will be a Godsend.\n\n\nI myself do not believe that a de novo creation of Adam is required, as I explained in my blog post Why There's No Conflict Between Evolution and A Historical Adam , I do not believe that Genesis 2 is really making a claim about Adam and Eve's material origins. My interpretation of Genesis 2 and 3 is the same as what John Walton lays out in his book The Lost World Of Adam and Eve: Genesis 2-3 and The Human Origins Debate. That said, I find it valuable to have a hypothesis like The Genealogical Adam and Eve which would allow one to accept macro-evolution but also interpret Genesis 2 as making that claim. And moreover, while I find most of Walton's work on Adam and Eve compelling, I found his treatment of Acts 17:11 and a couple of other texts implying Adam gave rise to all mankind (at least at the time of the first century) less than persuasive.\n\n\nIn any case, I find The Genealogical Adam and Eve (GAE) hypothesis scientifically valid and scripturally acceptable. He doesn't have to force-fit science into The Bible or distort The Bible to fit the science. Nor is he proposing any esoteric scientific ideas, like what we might dub creation science. If I were ever convinced that Genesis 2 did speak of material origins and not just archetypal aspects of Adam and Eve, Swamidass provides me with a nice fallback position. In any case, I think that, as with the miraculous birth of The Last Adam (Jesus), the miraculous birth of the first Adam (Adam) cannot be proven or disproven scientifically. And as to whether the historical Adam really did have parents or not, I'm now agnostic on the issue. I don't think that scripture compels me to embrace a de novo view of Adam and Eve's creation, but after reading Joshua Swamidass' book, I don't think science requires me to reject it either.\n\n\nIt is my deepest prayer that GAE will open doors for skeptics to take the claims of The Bible seriously and that it will open doors to Christians to take the claims of science seriously.\n\n\nThe Genealogical Adam and Eve will be available to purchase on December 10th of this year.\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMy Rating Of This Book\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\ue934\ue934\ue934\ue934\ue934 5/5",

    "abstract": "<jats:sec><jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>The following discussion delineates Philo's interpretation of Genesis 6:1-4 in his various treatises. The presentation provides a brief description of his understanding of the journey of the soul, which includes the origin of the soul, its place in the heavens, its time on earth, and its eventual return to the divine realm. Throughout the discussion, I will introduce various points of the interpretation of the Genesis passage found in the Watcher tradition of 1 Enoch and its adaptation in various documents in Second Temple Jewish literature. In doing so, I will highlight the similarities and differences between the interpretations which suggest Philo had knowledge of some form of the Watcher tradition and was perhaps attempting to write a corrective of its understanding of the problem of evil and the cause of human suffering in the first century C.E.</jats:p>\n         </jats:sec>",

    "abstractNote": "Associate Professor of Geological Sciences\n Jane Willenbring joined Stanford as an Associate Professor in the summer of 2020. Jane is a geologist who solves problems related to the Earth surface. Her research is primarily done to understand the evolution of the Earth\u2019s surface - especially how landscapes are affected by tectonics, climate change, and life. She and her research group use geochemical techniques, high-resolution topographic data, field observations, and, when possible, couple these data to landscape evolution numerical models and ice sheet models. The geochemical tools she uses and develops often include cosmogenic nuclide systems, which provide powerful, novel methods to constrain rates of erosion and mineral weathering. Jane has also started to organize citizen science campaigns and apply basic science principles to problems of human health with an ultimate broader impact goal of cleaning up urban areas and environments impacted by agriculture. She received her B.Sc. with honors from the North Dakota State University where she was a McNair Scholar and in the NDSU scholars program. She holds a Masters degree from Boston University. Her Ph.D. is in Earth Science from Dalhousie University in Halifax, Nova Scotia Canada where she was a Killam Scholar. She was a Synthesis Postdoctoral Fellow through the National Center for Earth Surface Dynamics at the Saint Anthony Falls Lab at the University of Minnesota, and an Alexander von Humboldt Postdoctoral Fellow and then subsequently a Postdoctoral Researcher at the Helmholz GFZ Potsdam, Germany.  Jane was previously an Associate Professor in the Geosciences Research Division and Thomas and Evelyn Page Chancellor's Endowed Faculty Fellow at Scripps Institution of Oceanography, UC San Diego where she was the director of the Scripps Cosmogenic Isotope Laboratory (SCI-Lab). She was also a tenure-track professor at the University of Pennsylvania. She will be a Stanford University Gabilan Faculty Fellow in 2021-2023. She is a Fellow of the Geological Society of America and was the inaugural recipient of the Marguerite T. Williams award from the American Geophysical Union.",

    "abstractNote": "\u201cFor indeed the day is coming, burning like a furnace, and all the arrogant evildoers will be chaff. The coming day will burn them up,\u201d says the Lord who rules over all. \u201cIt will not leave even a root or branch.  But for you who respect my name, the sun of vindication will rise with healing wings, and you will skip about like calves released from the stall.  You will trample on the wicked, for they will be like ashes under the soles of your feet on the day which I am preparing,\u201d says the Lord who rules over all.    \u201cRemember the law of my servant Moses, to whom at Horeb I gave rules and regulations for all Israel to obey.  Look, I will send you Elijah the prophet before the great and terrible day of the Lord arrives.  He will encourage fathers and their children to return to me, so that I will not come and strike the earth with judgment.\u201d    This is the record of the genealogy of Jesus Christ, the son of David, the son of Abraham.    Abraham was the father of Isaac, Isaac the father of Jacob, Jacob the father of Judah and his brothers,  Judah the father of Perez and Zerah (by Tamar), Perez the father of Hezron, Hezron the father of Ram,  Ram the father of Amminadab, Amminadab the father of Nahshon, Nahshon the father of Salmon,  Salmon the father of Boaz (by Rahab), Boaz the father of Obed (by Ruth), Obed the father of Jesse,  and Jesse the father of David the king.   David was the father of Solomon (by the wife of Uriah),  Solomon the father of Rehoboam, Rehoboam the father of Abijah, Abijah the father of Asa,  Asa the father of Jehoshaphat, Jehoshaphat the father of Joram, Joram the father of Uzziah,  Uzziah the father of Jotham, Jotham the father of Ahaz, Ahaz the father of Hezekiah,  Hezekiah the father of Manasseh, Manasseh the father of Amon, Amon the father of Josiah,  and Josiah the father of Jeconiah and his brothers, at the time of the deportation to Babylon.    After the deportation to Babylon, Jeconiah became the father of Shealtiel, Shealtiel the father of Zerubbabel,  Zerubbabel the father of Abiud, Abiud the father of Eliakim, Eliakim the father of Azor,  Azor the father of Zadok, Zadok the father of Achim, Achim the father of Eliud,  Eliud the father of Eleazar, Eleazar the father of Matthan, Matthan the father of Jacob,  and Jacob the father of Joseph, the husband of Mary, by whom Jesus was born, who is called Christ.    So all the generations from Abraham to David are fourteen generations, and from David to the deportation to Babylon, fourteen generations, and from the deportation to Babylon to Christ, fourteen generations.    Now the birth of Jesus Christ happened this way. While his mother Mary was engaged to Joseph, but before they came together, she was found to be pregnant through the Holy Spirit.  Because Joseph, her husband to be, was a righteous man, and because he did not want to disgrace her, he intended to divorce her privately.  When he had contemplated this, an angel of the Lord appeared to him in a dream and said, \u201cJoseph, son of David, do not be afraid to take Mary as your wife, because the child conceived in her is from the Holy Spirit.  She will give birth to a son and you will name him Jesus, because he will save his people from their sins.\u201d  This all happened so that what was spoken by the Lord through the prophet would be fulfilled:  \u201cLook! The virgin will conceive and bear a son, and they will call him Emmanuel,\u201d which means \u201cGod with us.\u201d  When Joseph awoke from sleep he did what the angel of the Lord told him. He took his wife,  but did not have marital relations with her until she gave birth to a son, whom he named Jesus.    After Jesus was born in Bethlehem in Judea, in the time of King Herod, wise men from the East came to Jerusalem  saying, \u201cWhere is the one who is born king of the Jews? For we saw his star when it rose and have come to worship him.\u201d  When King Herod heard this he was alarmed, and all Jerusalem with him.  After assembling all the chief priests and experts in the law, he asked them where the Christ was to be born.  \u201cIn Bethlehem of Judea,\u201d they said, \u201cfor it is written this way by the prophet:    \u2018And you, Bethlehem, in the land of Judah,   are in no way least among the rulers of Judah,   for out of you will come a ruler who will shepherd my people Israel.\u2019\u201d    Then Herod privately summoned the wise men and determined from them when the star had appeared.  He sent them to Bethlehem and said, \u201cGo and look carefully for the child. When you find him, inform me so that I can go and worship him as well.\u201d  After listening to the king they left, and once again the star they saw when it rose led them until it stopped above the place where the child was.  When they saw the star they shouted joyfully.  As they came into the house and saw the child with Mary his mother, they bowed down and worshiped him. They opened their treasure boxes and gave him gifts of gold, frankincense, and myrrh.  After being warned in a dream not to return to Herod, they went back by another route to their own country.    After they had gone, an angel of the Lord appeared to Joseph in a dream and said, \u201cGet up, take the child and his mother and flee to Egypt, and stay there until I tell you, for Herod is going to look for the child to kill him.\u201d  Then he got up, took the child and his mother during the night, and went to Egypt.  He stayed there until Herod died. In this way what was spoken by the Lord through the prophet was fulfilled: \u201cI called my Son out of Egypt.\u201d    When Herod saw that he had been tricked by the wise men, he became enraged. He sent men to kill all the children in Bethlehem and throughout the surrounding region from the age of two and under, according to the time he had learned from the wise men.  Then what was spoken by Jeremiah the prophet was fulfilled:    \u201cA voice was heard in Ramah,   weeping and loud wailing,   Rachel weeping for her children,   and she did not want to be comforted, because they were gone.\u201d    After Herod had died, an angel of the Lord appeared in a dream to Joseph in Egypt  saying, \u201cGet up, take the child and his mother, and go to the land of Israel, for those who were seeking the child\u2019s life are dead.\u201d  So he got up and took the child and his mother and returned to the land of Israel.  But when he heard that Archelaus was reigning over Judea in place of his father Herod, he was afraid to go there. After being warned in a dream, he went to the regions of Galilee.  He came to a town called Nazareth and lived there. Then what had been spoken by the prophets was fulfilled, that Jesus would be called a Nazarene.",

After they had gone, an angel of the Lord appeared to Joseph in a dream and said, \u201cGet up, take the child and his mother and flee to Egypt, and stay there until I tell you, for Herod is going to look for the child to kill him.\u201d  Then he got up, took the child and his mother during the night, and went to Egypt.  He stayed there until Herod died. In this way what was spoken by the Lord through the prophet was fulfilled: \u201cI called my Son out of Egypt.\u201d    When Herod saw that he had been tricked by the wise men, he became enraged. He sent men to kill all the children in Bethlehem and throughout the surrounding region from the age of two and under, according to the time he had learned from the wise men.  Then what was spoken by Jeremiah the prophet was fulfilled:    \u201cA voice was heard in Ramah,   weeping and loud wailing,   Rachel weeping for her children,   and she did not want to be comforted, because they were gone.\u201d    After Herod had died, an angel of the Lord appeared in a dream to Joseph in Egypt  saying, \u201cGet up, take the child and his mother, and go to the land of Israel, for those who were seeking the child\u2019s life are dead.\u201d  So he got up and took the child and his mother and returned to the land of Israel.  But when he heard that Archelaus was reigning over Judea in place of his father Herod, he was afraid to go there. After being warned in a dream, he went to the regions of Galilee.  He came to a town called Nazareth and lived there. Then what had been spoken by the prophets was fulfilled, that Jesus would be called a Nazarene.",

The coming day will burn them up,\u201d says the Lord who rules over all. \u201cIt will not leave even a root or branch.  But for you who respect my name, the sun of vindication will rise with healing wings, and you will skip about like calves released from the stall.  You will trample on the wicked, for they will be like ashes under the soles of your feet on the day which I am preparing,\u201d says the Lord who rules over all.    \u201cRemember the law of my servant Moses, to whom at Horeb I gave rules and regulations for all Israel to obey.  Look, I will send you Elijah the prophet before the great and terrible day of the Lord arrives.  He will encourage fathers and their children to return to me, so that I will not come and strike the earth with judgment.\u201d    This is the record of the genealogy of Jesus Christ, the son of David, the son of Abraham.    Abraham was the father of Isaac, Isaac the father of Jacob, Jacob the father of Judah and his brothers,  Judah the father of Perez and Zerah (by Tamar), Perez the father of Hezron, Hezron the father of Ram,  Ram the father of Amminadab, Amminadab the father of Nahshon, Nahshon the father of Salmon,  Salmon the father of Boaz (by Rahab), Boaz the father of Obed (by Ruth), Obed the father of Jesse,  and Jesse the father of David the king.   David was the father of Solomon (by the wife of Uriah),  Solomon the father of Rehoboam, Rehoboam the father of Abijah, Abijah the father of Asa,  Asa the father of Jehoshaphat, Jehoshaphat the father of Joram, Joram the father of Uzziah,  Uzziah the father of Jotham, Jotham the father of Ahaz, Ahaz the father of Hezekiah,  Hezekiah the father of Manasseh, Manasseh the father of Amon, Amon the father of Josiah,  and Josiah the father of Jeconiah and his brothers, at the time of the deportation to Babylon.    After the deportation to Babylon, Jeconiah became the father of Shealtiel, Shealtiel the father of Zerubbabel,  Zerubbabel the father of Abiud, Abiud the father of Eliakim, Eliakim the father of Azor,  Azor the father of Zadok, Zadok the father of Achim, Achim the father of Eliud,  Eliud the father of Eleazar, Eleazar the father of Matthan, Matthan the father of Jacob,  and Jacob the father of Joseph, the husband of Mary, by whom Jesus was born, who is called Christ.    So all the generations from Abraham to David are fourteen generations, and from David to the deportation to Babylon, fourteen generations, and from the deportation to Babylon to Christ, fourteen generations.    Now the birth of Jesus Christ happened this way. While his mother Mary was engaged to Joseph, but before they came together, she was found to be pregnant through the Holy Spirit.  Because Joseph, her husband to be, was a righteous man, and because he did not want to disgrace her, he intended to divorce her privately.  When he had contemplated this, an angel of the Lord appeared to him in a dream and said, \u201cJoseph, son of David, do not be afraid to take Mary as your wife, because the child conceived in her is from the Holy Spirit.  She will give birth to a son and you will name him Jesus, because he will save his people from their sins.\u201d  This all happened so that what was spoken by the Lord through the prophet would be fulfilled:  \u201cLook! The virgin will conceive and bear a son, and they will call him Emmanuel,\u201d which means \u201cGod with us.\u201d  When Joseph awoke from sleep he did what the angel of the Lord told him. He took his wife,  but did not have marital relations with her until she gave birth to a son, whom he named Jesus.    After Jesus was born in Bethlehem in Judea, in the time of King Herod, wise men from the East came to Jerusalem  saying, \u201cWhere is the one who is born king of the Jews? For we saw his star when it rose and have come to worship him.\u201d  When King Herod heard this he was alarmed, and all Jerusalem with him.  After assembling all the chief priests and experts in the law, he asked them where the Christ was to be born.  \u201cIn Bethlehem of Judea,\u201d they said, \u201cfor it is written this way by the prophet:    \u2018And you, Bethlehem, in the land of Judah,   are in no way least among the rulers of Judah,   for out of you will come a ruler who will shepherd my people Israel.\u2019\u201d    Then Herod privately summoned the wise men and determined from them when the star had appeared.  He sent them to Bethlehem and said, \u201cGo and look carefully for the child. When you find him, inform me so that I can go and worship him as well.\u201d  After listening to the king they left, and once again the star they saw when it rose led them until it stopped above the place where the child was.  When they saw the star they shouted joyfully.  As they came into the house and saw the child with Mary his mother, they bowed down and worshiped him. They opened their treasure boxes and gave him gifts of gold, frankincense, and myrrh.  After being warned in a dream not to return to Herod, they went back by another route to their own country.

Then what was spoken by Jeremiah the prophet was fulfilled:    \u201cA voice was heard in Ramah,   weeping and loud wailing,   Rachel weeping for her children,   and she did not want to be comforted, because they were gone.\u201d    After Herod had died, an angel of the Lord appeared in a dream to Joseph in Egypt  saying, \u201cGet up, take the child and his mother, and go to the land of Israel, for those who were seeking the child\u2019s life are dead.\u201d  So he got up and took the child and his mother and returned to the land of Israel.  But when he heard that Archelaus was reigning over Judea in place of his father Herod, he was afraid to go there. After being warned in a dream, he went to the regions of Galilee.  He came to a town called Nazareth and lived there. Then what had been spoken by the prophets was fulfilled, that Jesus would be called a Nazarene.",

As the author explains, despite the common use of the expression \u201claws of nature\u201d by both scientists and laymen, there is a long-standing tradition of philosophical debate about, and even refusal of, the notion that laws of nature might exist independently of a divine or human mind.",

Yet a proper understanding of species is important fora number of reasons. Species are the fundamental taxonomic units ofbiological classification.  Environmental laws are framed in terms ofspecies. Even our conception of human nature is affected by ourunderstanding of species. In this entry, three issuesconcerning species are discussed. The first is the ontological statusof species. The second is whether biologists should be speciespluralists or species monists. The third is whether the theoreticalterm \u2018species\u2019 refers to a real category in nature.",
